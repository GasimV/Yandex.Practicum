# Moscow vs. St. Petersburg Music Analysis

Welcome to the Moscow vs. St. Petersburg Music Analysis project repository. In this project, we aim to compare the behavior of users and their music preferences in Moscow and St. Petersburg using real Yandex Music data. We will test hypotheses related to user activity, genre preferences, and how they manifest differently in the two cities.

## Project Description

The project is centered around debunking myths and stereotypes about Moscow and St. Petersburg. We will use real Yandex Music data to test hypotheses and gain insights into the behavior of users in these two Russian capitals.

### Hypotheses

1. User activity depends on the day of the week, and this behavior differs between Moscow and St. Petersburg.
2. Moscow and St. Petersburg exhibit different music genre preferences, especially on Monday mornings and Friday evenings.
3. Moscow favors pop music, while St. Petersburg leans towards Russian rap.

### Data

The dataset is stored in the file `yandex_music_project.csv`. On the platform, it is located at `/datasets/yandex_music_project.csv`. You can download the dataset for external analysis using [this link](#).

- `userID`: User identifier
