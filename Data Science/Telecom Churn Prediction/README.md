# TeleDom Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for the telecom operator TeleDom. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze customer data to identify patterns and characteristics that indicate the likelihood of customers discontinuing their service. This information is crucial for TeleDom to implement strategies to retain their customers.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of information about TeleDom's customers, including personal details, contract information, internet and phone service details. The data is stored across four tables in a PostgreSQL database:

- `contract`: Contract information including payment type, charges, etc.
- `personal`: Personal information of customers like gender, senior citizen status, etc.
- `internet`: Internet service details like connection type and additional services.
- `phone`: Phone service details, including multiple line connections.

## Installation and Setup

**Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GasimV/TeleDom-Churn-Prediction.git
   ```

## Roadmap
