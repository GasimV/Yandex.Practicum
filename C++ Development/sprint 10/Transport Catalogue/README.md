The Transport Catalogue program is a C++ application designed to manage and process transportation data, including the creation of a transport database, handling user requests, and generating map renderings. Its workflow can be divided into several key components:

1. **Data Input and Parsing**:
   - The program reads input data in JSON format, which includes information about bus routes, stops, and rendering settings.
   - The `json_reader` module is responsible for parsing this input data and extracting relevant information.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Parsed data is stored in the `TransportCatalogue` class, which maintains records of bus stops, routes, and the relationships between them.
   - This class provides efficient retrieval of information necessary for processing user queries.

3. **Request Handling**:
   - The program processes various types of user requests, such as retrieving information about specific bus routes or stops.
   - The `request_handler` module manages these queries, interacting with the `TransportCatalogue` to fetch and format the required data.

4. **Map Rendering**:
   - For visual representation, the `map_renderer` module generates SVG images depicting bus routes and stops.
   - It utilizes the stored data and rendering settings to create accurate and informative maps.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The results of user requests and rendered maps are formatted into JSON responses.
   - These responses are then outputted, providing users with the requested information in a structured format.

This modular approach ensures that the Transport Catalogue program efficiently handles transportation data, processes user requests, and generates visual representations as needed.

To illustrate the workflow of the Transport Catalogue program, let's consider an example input and trace it through the system to understand how the output is generated.

### **Example Input**
```json
{
  "base_requests": [
    {
      "type": "Stop",
      "name": "Stop A",
      "latitude": 55.611087,
      "longitude": 37.20829,
      "road_distances": {
        "Stop B": 1200,
        "Stop C": 800
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Stop",
      "name": "Stop B",
      "latitude": 55.595884,
      "longitude": 37.209755,
      "road_distances": {
        "Stop C": 600
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Bus",
      "name": "Bus 1",
      "stops": ["Stop A", "Stop B", "Stop C", "Stop A"],
      "is_roundtrip": true
    }
  ],
  "stat_requests": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "Bus",
      "name": "Bus 1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "Stop",
      "name": "Stop A"
    }
  ],
  "render_settings": {
    "width": 800,
    "height": 400,
    "padding": 50
  }
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

#### 1. **Data Input and Parsing**
The input JSON is read by the `json_reader` module. It processes three main sections:
- **`base_requests`**: Contains definitions for stops and buses. This data is parsed and stored in the `TransportCatalogue`.
- **`stat_requests`**: Specifies user queries for information retrieval.
- **`render_settings`**: Defines parameters for map rendering.

#### 2. **Data Storage**
- **Stops**:
  - Stop A is stored with coordinates `(55.611087, 37.20829)` and distances to Stop B (1200m) and Stop C (800m).
  - Stop B is stored with coordinates `(55.595884, 37.209755)` and distances to Stop C (600m).
- **Bus**:
  - "Bus 1" is stored as a circular route: `["Stop A", "Stop B", "Stop C", "Stop A"]`.

#### 3. **Request Handling**
- For **`Bus 1`**, the `request_handler` calculates:
  - Number of stops: 4 (A → B → C → A).
  - Number of unique stops: 3 (A, B, C).
  - Route length: Computed using `road_distances` (1200 + 600 + 800 = 2600m).
  - Geographical length: Calculated as the sum of great-circle distances between stops.
  - Curvature: The ratio of route length to geographical length.
- For **`Stop A`**, the `request_handler` provides:
  - Buses passing through: ["Bus 1"].

#### 4. **Map Rendering**
- The `map_renderer` uses stop coordinates and bus routes to generate an SVG map with:
  - Dimensions 800x400, with 50px padding.
  - Circles for stops and lines for bus routes.
  - Labels for stops and buses.

#### 5. **Output Generation**
The responses are formatted as a JSON array.

### **Example Output**
```json
[
  {
    "request_id": 1,
    "curvature": 1.23,
    "route_length": 2600,
    "stop_count": 4,
    "unique_stop_count": 3
  },
  {
    "request_id": 2,
    "buses": ["Bus 1"]
  },
  {
    "map": "<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\">
      <circle cx=\"...\" cy=\"...\" r=\"5\" fill=\"red\" />
      <text x=\"...\" y=\"...\">Stop A</text>
      <line x1=\"...\" y1=\"...\" x2=\"...\" y2=\"...\" stroke=\"blue\" />
    </svg>"
  }
]
```

### **Explanation**
1. The **first response** provides statistics for Bus 1, including curvature, route length, and stop counts.
2. The **second response** lists all buses passing through Stop A.
3. The **third response** includes an SVG representation of the transport map.

This showcases how the program handles data ingestion, processing, and output generation for practical use cases.
